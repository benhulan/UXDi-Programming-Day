## Overview of Back End Development

##### Introduction
- Why is a back end needed?
- How does the back end interact with the front end? 
- APIs and services.
- Back end language examples:
	- Ruby (Ruby on Rails)
	- PHP
	- Python (Django)
	- JavaScript (NodeJS)

##### Databases
- Difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.
	- MySQL
	- PostgresSQL
	- MongoDB
	- Redis

## Architecture Design Lab

Let's look at some popular sites and determine what technologies could be used. Think about the interaction between backend and frontend and how they fit together.

Your answer doesn't have to be the "right" one (the technology they actually use), but we just want you to demonstrate you understand how each piece fits together. You can choose your own site to analyze, but here are some examples:

- Twitter
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Medium

## Introduction to Algorithms
- Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for various calculations.
- They are generally used for data processing and automated reasoning.
- Algorithms are used in programming to perform calculations useful to the application.
- Examples of algorithms:
	- Search for values in a database by location.
	- Find the shortest path between two points.
	- Determine the most popular songs for a given demographic.
	- Suggest friends that you may know based on certain criteria.

## Algorithm Lab
- In groups of 3-4 think of how we may accomplish the above algorithms using programming.
- You definitely don't need to come up with any code, but just think conceptually as to how these could be solved.
- Draw out your concepts visually.
